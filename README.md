# Automated Calendar Invitations

- Automatically creates Google Calendar invitations for the schedule of Tech-Onboarding by fetching the emails and joining date from Google Form.

- Copy the code from apps-script/calendar.js and paste inside apps script IDE. Save the file as calendar.gs, and save the project as Onboarding Calendar.

- The script is integrated with a private Google form ID `1OXCKgB8F8DWB1Fwqq0uunCtWry-FZr5_tt9yd_Mj5h41`.

- On running the script for the first time, it asks for authorization permission.

- Upon getting authorized from the default account, the script later gets auto-triggered whenever someone submits the Google form.

- Check the calendar invitations.
